Once just a humble hatchling from the mean reeds of Duckago, Al Quackpone rose through the ranks of the underfeather world with a bill full of ambition and a heart as cold as pond ice. Known for running the infamous Featherweight Syndicate, he ruled the lily pad racket, bread crumb bootlegging, and the notorious quack market with an iron wing.

His favorite hangouts include speakeasies like The Downy Dive and The Pond Noir, where he’s often seen sipping pondwater martinis and brooding over his next big splash. Don’t let the waddling fool you—he’s got a beak for business and a wing in every shady deal.

Rumor has it he once ducked 37 charges in a single trial, earning him the nickname “The Untouchable Tailfeather.” But behind the suave feathers and sharp fedora lies a bird haunted by breadcrumbs of the past.

Whether he's swimming in dough or dodging the fuzz, one thing’s for sure: when Al Quackpone’s around, it’s best to stay out of the water.
