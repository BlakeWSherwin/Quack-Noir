Downspawn was not hatched—he was rejected by the pond itself, cast into the abyss where gravity and sanity unravel. There, he learned to invert existence, turning the concept of “up” into a cruel joke. His upside-down gait is not mere locomotion—it’s a ritual, each step a glyph that summons whispers from the deep. Cultists call him the “Duck of Reversal,” the one who walks where no waddle should.

Erratic and gleefully deranged, Downspawn delights in inversion—of physics, of minds, of expectations. He quacks in riddles that sound backward, and his laughter echoes like ripples in reverse. 

Cultists who try to mimic his stance often snap their spines before they finish the first step.
