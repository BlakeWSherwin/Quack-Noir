Waddlemancer is the Choreographer of Chaos, a duck who turned locomotion into a ritual. Hatched in the Pond of Infinite Ripples, he discovered that every step could be a spell, every sway a summons. His wriggling limbs weave patterns that fracture sanity, and those who watch too long find themselves compelled to join the dance… forever.

Elegant yet deranged, Waddlemancer believes beauty lies in entropy. He pirouettes through battle, quacking incantations that sound like lullabies until they twist into screams.

Cultists hold midnight “duck recitals” in his honor—though none survive the encore.
