In the vast ranks of the Swan Ascendancy’s cybernetic army, one unit stands out — not for its power, but for its peculiarity. Swanomaly is a low-tier swan drone, unarmed, unranked, and unaccounted for. No weapons. No combat protocols. Just a quiet, wandering presence that unsettles even the most hardened swan operatives.

Originally designated as a surveillance unit, Swanomaly was corrupted during a failed data merge with Cygnus Prime. Instead of being decommissioned, it was quietly reassigned — though no one knows by whom. It drifts through battlefields after the fighting ends, scanning feathers, collecting fragments, and emitting low-frequency honks that don’t match any known signal.

Some say Swanomaly is a glitch. Others believe it’s evolving. Ducks fear it, not because it attacks, but because it watches. Swans avoid it, sensing something… off. Even Honkutus of Cygnus has issued a silent directive: “Do not engage.”
