Once a proud drake, Molted Menace underwent a molt that never ended. Each feather shed peeled away sanity, leaving only raw horror beneath. The ichor that oozes from his form is said to be the liquefied essence of every pond he’s ever defiled—a toxic brew of algae, despair, and eldritch whispers. His tentacles twitch with hunger for what lies beneath the surface… and beyond.

Unstable and unhinged, Molted Menace is obsessed with transformation. He believes molting is the first step toward transcendence—and that everyone else should molt… violently.

He claims his molt is “natural,” but the cultists who summoned him disagree—they’re still trying to scrub the ichor stains off their robes.
