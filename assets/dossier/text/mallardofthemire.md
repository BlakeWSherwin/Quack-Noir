Mallard of the Mire was hatched from an egg carved with runes no sane beak could inscribe. His tentacles writhe with forbidden knowledge, each glyph a syllable of a quack so cosmic it unravels minds. The sores across his body are not wounds—they are mouths, whispering secrets that should never ripple across reality. Wherever he waddles, sanity sinks like a stone in a stagnant pond.

Unpredictable and unhinged, Mallard of the Mire is a prophet of entropy. He quacks in tongues older than time, and every syllable gnaws at the edges of comprehension.

He claims to have invented “duck philosophy”—but his teachings mostly involve staring into the void until it quacks back.
