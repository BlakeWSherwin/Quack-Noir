Mirequacker is the Overgrowth of the Abyss, a creature born when the concept of “duck” collided with unchecked excess. Hatched in the deepest mire where light dares not ripple, he grew… and grew… until his tentacles outnumbered reason itself. Each limb is a conduit to something older than ponds, older than quacks—a hunger that stretches across dimensions.

Chaotic and insatiable, Mirequacker doesn’t think—he thrashes. His movements churn the ground into sludge, his quacks bubble up like swamp gas, and his presence alone guarantees the end of dry land.

Cultists claim counting his tentacles is a path to enlightenment. Most stop counting when they run out of sanity.
