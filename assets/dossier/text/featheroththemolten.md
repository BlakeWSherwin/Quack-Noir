Born from the same blasphemous nest as Feathered Sleeper, Featheroth was the runt—half the size, but twice as volatile. Where his sibling slumbers in silence, Featheroth burns with restless fury, his molten essence warping the ground into bubbling sludge. Cultists whisper that he is the “Duck of the End Times,” destined to ignite the ponds and boil the skies.

Impulsive, wrathful, and obsessed with proving his worth. Featheroth despises being called “small” and compensates with catastrophic displays of molten power. His favorite phrase? “Size doesn’t matter when the pond is on fire.”

Cultists claim Featheroth’s upside-down stance is a sign of “rebellion against gravity”—but really, he just likes watching the world burn from a different angle.
