At the top of the pecking order, above Eggscobar, Goosey Smalls, and every honker in the Ghetto, sits one goose whose name is spoken in whispers and feared in squawks: The Golden Goose. No one knows where he came from — some say he waddled out of a vault, others claim he was hatched in a nest lined with diamonds. But one thing is certain: he rules the Goose Ghetto with a gilded beak and an iron wing.

His most iconic feature? A beak full of solid gold teeth, each one engraved with the initials of rival flocks he’s crushed. It glints in the moonlight, unsettling allies and enemies alike. When he honks, it’s not just a sound — it’s a command, a warning, and a promise of power.

The Golden Goose doesn’t flap unless it’s necessary. He delegates to his lieutenants — Eggscobar for operations, Goose Willis for enforcement, Goosey Smalls for strategy, and Lil Goosey for chaos. But when things go wrong, when turf lines blur or crumbs go missing, he shows up. And when he does, the pond goes silent.

His empire spans every corner of the Ghetto — from the bakery backdoors to the fountain fronts. He controls the breadcrumb trade, the nesting rackets, and the underground honk-fighting rings. Even rival species know better than to cross him. Ducks avoid his turf. Swans respect his reach. And geese? They worship him.
