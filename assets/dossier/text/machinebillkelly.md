In the shadowy corners of Ducktown, where the fog rolls in thicker than gravy and the air smells faintly of gunpowder and pond scum, one name makes feathers tremble: Machine Bill Kelly. They call him “Machine” not because he’s made of gears and steel, but because he moves with cold precision—like clockwork, like fate, like trouble.

A former jazz drummer turned enforcer, Bill’s got a beat in his bones and a vendetta in his heart. He once played the hottest clubs in the city—The Quack Shack, Feather & Smoke, and The Downy Note—until a double-crossed gig left him with broken wings and a thirst for justice. Now, he keeps time with a snub-nosed revolver and a pocket full of grudges.

He’s the kind of duck who doesn’t ask questions—he just listens for the rhythm of lies and lets his fists do the talking. His trench coat smells like rain and regret, and his fedora’s seen more action than a goose at a bread convention.

His calling card?
A single drumstick left at the scene. Not the kind you eat. The kind you remember.
