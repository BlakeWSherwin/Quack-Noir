In the year 3025, when the skies are ruled by drones and the ponds are patrolled by bots, one swan rose from the ashes of a shattered aviary to lead a revolution — not for peace, but for vengeance. Cardi Beak, forged from titanium feathers and vengeance-coded circuits, is the leader of the Swan Uprising, a militant faction with one mission: eliminate every duck from existence.

Once a graceful ballet swan in the Royal Pond Circuit, Cardi Beak was betrayed by the Duck Dominion during the Great Molt War. Rebuilt by rogue engineers and powered by quantum honk technology, she now commands a fleet of cyber-swans known as the Featherstorm Unit, each programmed for precision strikes and aquatic domination.

Her signature weapon, the Beak Blaster, can vaporize a duck at 50 wingspans. Her wings double as sonic disruptors, and her honk — now digitized and weaponized — can scramble duck communication across entire wetlands. She’s feared, revered, and unstoppable.
