Feathered Sleeper is the Dreamer Beneath the Ripples, a being that slumbers in dimensions where ponds bleed into voids. He moves as if gravity itself fears him, his inverted gait a mockery of all that waddles. The tentacles on his back are said to be extensions of his dreaming mind—each one twitching with visions of horrors yet to hatch. When he finally opens his eyes, the world will molt into madness.

Silent, patient, and eerily serene. Feathered Sleeper does not quack—he hums in frequencies that seep into thoughts, planting nightmares like eggs.

Cultists believe he dreams the entire pond into existence—and when he wakes, it will drown in its own reflection.
