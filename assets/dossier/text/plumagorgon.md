Plumagorgon is the Herald of the Hollow Sky, the first duck to take flight into the void and return… wrong. His wings are said to be stitched from the shadows of extinct birds, and his elongated beak pierces not flesh, but the fragile membrane of reality. The ooze dripping from his form? No one knows what it is—only that ponds curdle and stars dim wherever it falls.

Majestic yet malevolent, Plumagorgon believes he is the final evolution of avian life—a god of wings and woe. He speaks in riddles that sound like quacks, but each syllable unravels sanity like loose down.

Cultists worship his molt as sacred relics, though touching them guarantees a lifetime of quacking nightmares.
