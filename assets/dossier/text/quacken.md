From the darkest depths of the duckdimension comes The Quacken — a slimy, greenish horror with tentacles that writhe like spaghetti in a storm. Once a humble pond-dweller, The Quacken was corrupted by forbidden fowl magic and now lurks beneath the lily pads, whispering quackthulhuan secrets to those who dare paddle too close.

Its eyes glow with an eerie mallardescence, and its honk echoes like a thousand cursed duck calls. With a wingspan that blots out the sun and tentacles that can snatch a swan mid-swoop, The Quacken is the stuff of feathered nightmares.

Legends say The Quacken was once a duck named Quibbles who pecked at a cursed loaf of sourdough tossed by a careless camper. Now, it seeks vengeance on all who mock the sacred art of bread-tossing. Some say it can be appeased with offerings of perfectly toasted rye, but most who try are never seen again — just a ripple and a single, ominous quack.
