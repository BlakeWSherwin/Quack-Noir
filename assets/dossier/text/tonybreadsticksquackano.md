In the back booths of Ducktown’s grimiest trattorias, one name gets whispered between bites of marinara and murmurs of murder: Tony “Breadsticks” Quackano. A duck with a taste for the finer things—garlic knots, power, and revenge—Tony rose from the crumbs of the streets to become the Mallard Mafia’s top earner and most unpredictable wildcard.

They call him “Breadsticks” because he always brings them to meetings—sometimes as a peace offering, sometimes as a weapon. He once took out a goose with a stale baguette and made it look like an accident. That’s just how Tony rolls.

He runs the Crumb Trade, controlling the flow of baked goods from the bakeries of Little Quackaly to the docks of Biscotti Bay. If it’s crusty, flaky, or stuffed with cheese, it’s passed through Tony’s wings first.

He’s got a temper like a toaster oven and a loyalty that’s buttered on both sides.
Tony’s the kind of duck who’ll kiss you on both cheeks, then have you whacked before dessert. But if you’re in his good graces, you’ll never go hungry—or get caught.
