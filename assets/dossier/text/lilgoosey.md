Lil Goosey might be the smallest in the flock, but he’s got the biggest attitude. Hatched during a thunderstorm in a puddle behind a liquor store, he came into the world honking and hasn’t stopped since. Raised on chaos and corn chips, Lil Goosey is the Goose Ghetto’s wildcard — unpredictable, untamed, and always ready to flap first and ask questions never.

He earned his stripes early, pulling off solo breadcrumb snatches and daring pond dives that left older geese squawking in disbelief. His signature move, the “Feather Flash,” involves a high-speed charge followed by a mid-air honk that disorients rivals and dazzles allies. He’s fast, flashy, and fiercely loyal to Eggscobar and the crew — especially Goosey Smalls, who took him under his wing and taught him the art of the hustle.

Lil Goosey’s got dreams bigger than the pond. He’s always talking about expanding the turf, starting his own crew, and launching a line of designer nests. But for now, he’s the go-to goose for high-risk missions, distraction tactics, and causing general mayhem wherever he waddles.
