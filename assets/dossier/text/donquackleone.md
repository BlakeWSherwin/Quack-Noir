Feared across every fountain and birdbath from Little Italy to Big Pond, Don Quackleone is the undisputed godfeather of the Mallard Mafia. With a voice as raspy as a goose in winter and a stare that could curdle pond scum, Don Quackleone commands respect—and breadcrumbs—with a flick of his wing.

Raised in the gritty canals of Quacklyn, he clawed his way to the top of the pecking order, leaving a trail of breadcrumbs and broken beaks. His empire spans the shady underbelly of duck society: protection rackets for nesting rights, illegal corn smuggling, and the infamous “fly-by-night” operations.

Despite his ruthless reputation, Don Quackleone is a family bird. He keeps his ducklings close and his enemies closer. But betray him, and you’ll be sleeping with the koi.

Legend says he once settled a turf war with nothing but a stern quack and a loaf of stale sourdough.
