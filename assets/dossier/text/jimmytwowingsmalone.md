If you hear the flapping of two wings in the dead of night, it’s already too late—Jimmy “Two Wings” Malone is in the air, and someone’s about to get plucked. The muscle behind the Mallard Mafia, Jimmy earned his nickname not for having two wings (which, let’s be honest, most ducks do), but for using both of them to deliver justice—one for the job, the other for the message.

Raised in the back alleys of Duckago, Jimmy started out as a low-level pond bouncer, keeping riff-raff out of Don Quackleone’s lily pad lounges. But after single-wingedly taking down a flock of rival geese in the infamous Feather Alley Rumble, he was promoted to Chief Beak-Breaker.

Known for his signature move, the Double-Wing Whammy, Jimmy doesn’t just ruffle feathers—he rearranges them. He’s loyal to the Don, but has a soft spot for ducklings and old hens, often seen feeding the pond pigeons when he’s not cracking eggs in backroom deals.
