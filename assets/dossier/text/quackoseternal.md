Quackos Eternal is the Origin of the Quack, the first sound that shattered silence and birthed madness. He was never hatched—he simply emerged when the concept of “duck” infected the cosmos. His countless tentacles are not limbs but anchors to infinity, rooting him in every reality at once. Wherever he moves, ponds boil, skies curdle, and the air fills with the sound of quacks echoing across eternity.

Cold, patient, and inevitable. Quackos Eternal does not chase—he waits, knowing all things will eventually sink into his mire. His speech is a chorus of overlapping quacks, each syllable a prophecy of doom.

Cultists claim his tentacles spell out the word “QUACK” in an ancient tongue—but those who try to read it dissolve into ichor before finishing the first letter.
