Goosey Smalls wasn’t born into the hustle — he invented it. Hatched behind a jazz club and raised on rhythm and rebellion, he’s the brains behind the Goose Ghetto’s most elaborate schemes. While Eggscobar runs the empire and Goose Willis keeps the streets clean, it’s Goosey who draws the blueprints, flips the crumbs, and talks his way out of trouble with a silver tongue and a platinum honk.

Known for his signature fedora and swaggered strut, Goosey Smalls built his reputation on finesse. He orchestrated the legendary “Breadbasket Heist,” where his crew lifted an entire bakery delivery off a moving truck — without ruffling a single feather. His charm is lethal, his plans airtight, and his loyalty to the flock unshakable.

Goosey’s specialties include turf negotiations, distraction tactics, and psychological warfare — often delivered through poetic honks and cryptic feather signals. He’s the goose you send when you need a deal made, a rival misled, or a situation flipped in your favor. His motto? “Never flap harder than you have to — just honk smarter.”

Whether he's gliding through a back-alley deal or dropping breadcrumbs of wisdom to the younger goslings, Goosey Smalls is the soul of the streets — smooth, sharp, and always two steps ahead.
