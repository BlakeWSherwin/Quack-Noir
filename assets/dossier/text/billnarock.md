At first glance, Billnarock looks almost… normal. His feathers are neat, his size unremarkable, and his waddle deceptively calm. But then you see his face—or what should be his face. Instead of a beak, there’s a writhing bouquet of tentacles, each slick with ichor and etched with runes that shimmer like pondlight in a nightmare. It’s said there are enough tendrils there to make the Great Beaked One quack with pride.

Billnarock was never truly hatched. His egg cracked open not by nature, but by whispers from the void. He emerged incomplete, a paradox of innocence and horror, carrying the promise of what should never be born. His tentacled visage is a living sigil, a lure for those who dare to gaze too long. Cultists call him the “Face of the Forbidden Nest”, and they believe his unhatched essence holds the key to summoning the Great Beaked One itself.
