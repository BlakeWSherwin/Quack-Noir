In the scorched wetlands of the post-avian future, where feathers are few and survival is a system reboot away, one machine rules the battlefield: The Honkinator. Fully mechanized, forged from the wreckage of fallen swans, and powered by a vengeance core, The Honkinator is the Swan Ascendancy’s most advanced duck extermination unit — a walking arsenal of destruction with no soul, no mercy, and one mission: terminate all ducks.

Designed by Cygnus Prime as the final solution to the duck problem, The Honkinator is equipped with:

•	Dual Beak Cannons capable of launching sonic honk blasts that liquefy duck formations.
•	Featherblade Rotors for close-quarters combat, spinning at speeds that slice through nests and necks alike.
•	Thermal Quack Sensors that detect duck vocalizations from miles away.
•	Adaptive Pond-Terrain Legs for seamless movement across mud, marsh, and water.

Unlike Cardi Beak or Feather Krueger, The Honkinator has no personality — only protocols. It doesn’t speak. It doesn’t hesitate. It simply scans, locks, and honks. Ducks call it “The Final Flap.” Swans call it “Perfection.”
