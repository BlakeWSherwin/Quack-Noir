Spawned from an ancient, cursed sourdough starter said to predate bread—and sanity—Artisanal Sourduck rose from the doughy depths to spread despair one slice at a time. This starter was whispered into existence by cultists chanting “rise and shine” under a blood moon, and it’s been fermenting madness ever since. His sourdough essence is steeped in forbidden yeast, giving him the power to leaven entire dimensions.

Crusty, bitter, and always rising to the occasion. He believes life is all about loaf and death.
