The Great Beaked One is the First Quack and the Last Silence, the origin of all ponds and the doom of all shores. It was never hatched—it simply was, lurking in the void before time, dreaming of ripples that would one day consume existence. Every duck, every feather, every pond is but an echo of its infinite waddle. Cults across dimensions whisper its name in bubbling tones, offering eggs and sanity alike to summon its gaze. When it rises, the skies curdle, the waters boil, and the sound of its quack reverberates through eternity, heralding the end of all migration.

Unknowable. Its thoughts are tides, its will is gravity. It does not speak—it quacks, and that sound alone can shatter worlds.

Those who glimpse its full form never return—except as feathers scattered across the cosmos.
