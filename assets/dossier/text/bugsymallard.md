Smooth as pond silk and twice as slippery, Bugsy Mallard is the top dealer in the duck underworld. Whether you’re looking for premium pondweed, black-market birdseed, or a rare imported loaf of rye, Bugsy’s your bird. He’s got connections from the wetlands of Vegas to the swamps of Atlantic Quack City.

Once a small-time hustler selling soggy crackers behind the lily pads, Bugsy rose to fame with his signature charm, flashy feathers, and a suitcase full of “quack” merchandise.

He’s always dressed to impress—pinstripe vest, gold-plated beak ring, and a monocle that screams “I’m shady, but classy.” His hideout, The Gilded Gander, is half nightclub, half negotiation table, and all trouble.

Despite his shady dealings, Bugsy’s got a code: never sell to ducklings, never short a swan, and always pay the Don his cut. Cross him, and you’ll find yourself featherless in a back alley, wondering how you got out-hustled by a bird in spats.
