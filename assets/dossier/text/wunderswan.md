Towering above the wetlands like a monument to extinction, Wunderswan is the Swan Ascendancy’s ultimate weapon — a colossal, sentient war machine forged from neutronium alloy, quantum processors, and ancient swan DNA. It is the original architect of the Swan-Duck War, the true mind behind Cygnus Prime, and the final honk in the saga of avian supremacy.

Wunderswan is a walking apocalypse. Its wings span city blocks, its beak doubles as a railgun, and its honk — the dreaded Honk of Extinction — can rupture duck eardrums and disable resistance tech across continents. It commands the skies, the ponds, and the very data streams of the avian world.

But despite its overwhelming power, Wunderswan has one glaring flaw: it tries to quack.
In a misguided attempt to infiltrate duck ranks and sow confusion, Wunderswan developed a “Quack Simulation Protocol.” Unfortunately, the results are… less than convincing. The quacks are distorted, metallic, and unsettling — more like a blender full of gravel than anything resembling a duck. Ducks immediately recognize the deception, often responding with laughter before fleeing in terror.

The failure rate? 100%.
The embarrassment? Classified.
