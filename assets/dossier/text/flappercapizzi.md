In the smoky underbelly of Ducktown, where the shadows stretch long and the breadcrumbs are always stale, Flapper Capizzi is the smooth-talking, wing-flapping negotiator every mob boss wants on their side—and every rival wants out of the picture.

They call him “Flapper” not just for the way he glides into a room like a jazz riff on pondwater, but for the way he flaps his wings when he’s making a point—usually while brokering a deal, bluffing at cards, or dodging bullets. He’s the Mallard Mafia’s top fixer, a duck who can talk his way out of a shootout and into a five-course meal.

Raised in the back canals of Quacksterdam, Flapper learned early that words could be weapons—and he’s been armed to the beak ever since. He’s got a silver tongue, a golden watch, and a platinum reputation for getting things done without ruffling too many feathers.
