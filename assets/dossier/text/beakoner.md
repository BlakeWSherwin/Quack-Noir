The Beakoner is the Caller of the Abyssal Flock, a harbinger whose quack summons horrors from ponds unseen. Hatched in silence beneath a blood moon, he learned early that sound is power—and his voice is a lure no mind can resist. His tentacles ripple like reeds in a cursed wind, beckoning prey closer with every twitch. Those who follow the sound of his call never return… except as echoes.

Seductive and sinister, The Beakoner thrives on curiosity. He doesn’t chase—he invites. His quacks are soft, almost soothing, until they twist into screams that peel sanity like feathers. His favorite phrase? “Come closer… the pond is warm.”

Cultists claim his eyes are borrowed from a cosmic predator—but none dare ask what happened to the original owner.
