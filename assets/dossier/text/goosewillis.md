Goose Willis isn’t here to honk — he’s here to handle business. Hatched in the back alley of a broken fountain and raised on cold fries and colder stares, Willis earned his reputation as the Goose Ghetto’s toughest beak. While Eggscobar runs the empire, it’s Goose Willis who keeps the streets in line, cracking down on rogue flocks and keeping the pond peace — by any means necessary.

A veteran of the infamous “Featherfall Incident,” where he single-wingedly took down a swan hit squad with nothing but grit and a sharpened breadstick, Willis became a legend overnight. His feathers are ruffled, his past is murky, and his honk carries the weight of a thousand turf wars. He doesn’t talk much, but when he does, it’s usually followed by a chase, a flap, or a splash.

Known for his signature move — the “Fly Hard” divebomb — Goose Willis is the muscle behind Eggscobar’s empire. He patrols the pond with a steely glare and a no-nonsense waddle, making sure every goose knows the rules: respect the turf, pay your crumbs, and never cross the flock.

Whether he’s breaking up a breadcrumb heist or staring down a rogue mallard, Goose Willis is the last honk you hear before things get real.
