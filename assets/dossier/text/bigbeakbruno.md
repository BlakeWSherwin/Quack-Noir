In the grimy gutters of Ducktown, where the fog rolls in thicker than mashed peas and the only thing colder than the pond is the welcome, Big Beak Bruno is the enforcer you call when negotiations need a little... emphasis. Towering over most mallards and built like a bread truck, Bruno’s beak is less a facial feature and more a blunt instrument of persuasion.

He’s not known for brains, but he’s got instincts sharper than a swan’s side-eye. Raised in the back alleys of Beakridge, Bruno learned early that in this town, you either peck first or get plucked. He’s been Don Quackleone’s personal wingman for years, handling “situations” with a quiet nod and a thunderous flap.

His specialties include:

•	Intimidation by proximity
•	Beak-to-beak negotiations
•	Strategic pondside silence

He rarely speaks, but when he does, it’s usually followed by someone diving for cover.

Big Beak Bruno doesn’t do subtle. He does presence.
