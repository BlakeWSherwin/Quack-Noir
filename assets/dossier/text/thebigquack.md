Nobody sees The Big Quack—they just feel the ripple. The boss of bosses, the beak behind the curtain, the duck whose name is whispered with reverence and fear in every back-alley birdbath from Ducktown to Pond City. He’s the architect of the Mallard Mafia, the one who turned breadcrumbs into currency and lily pads into kingdoms.

No one knows his real name. Some say he’s older than the pond itself, others claim he’s just a myth—an idea with feathers. But those who’ve met him never forget the sound: a single, echoing quack that means your fate’s been sealed.

He runs the show from a hidden estate known only as The Nest Egg, guarded by swans with sniper scopes and geese who don’t blink. His lieutenants—Don Quackleone, Al Quackpone, Flapper Capizzi, and the rest—answer to him, and him alone.

His signature?
A golden feather, left on the scene like a calling card.

His motto?
“Every ripple starts with a quack.”
The Big Quack doesn’t make threats. He makes history.
